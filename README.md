I'm a software engineer who's very passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in general. I think tech should make a positive impact on society and I try to cotribute, even if just a little, with my small projects.

### I'm glad you are here! &nbsp; ![visitors](https://visitor-badge.glitch.me/badge?page_id=https://github.com/mwritescode/mwritescode)

- 😄 Pronouns: She / Her
- 🌱 I’m currently learning NLP and Speech Recognition
- 👩‍💻 I love ML, but would also love to get more experience in UX Design and Web Dev
- ⚡ Fun fact: I think learning a new programming language is actually quite similar to learning a new language. I'm equally as facinated by human languages and considered studying Foreign Languages in my Bachelor dregree before deciding on Computer Science. I currently speak fluently Italian and English and I'm learning German and French.
- 💬 Ask me about whatever you want, I'm happy to help
